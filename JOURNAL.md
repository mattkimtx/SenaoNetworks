# Journal Info
Hi! This is my journal which I plan to update whenever I work on projects or anything related to my internship. Each week, I come to the office Monday, Wednesday, and Friday before 8:30 AM and leave at 11:00 AM to attend my Chinese language classes at the National Taiwan University. The rest of my work is done remotely, and the in-person office days serve as a time when I can ask questions and continue doing work. While I am at the office, I also participate in the team check-in meetings at 10:30 AM. 

## Format
Each entry will be formatted by date, work done, and a short description.

-- Day 0: After my language classes at the Chinese Language Department at National Taiwan University, I came to the Nangang office to meet with Nita, Roger, and my boss Mr. Len Chen 陳敬之. I was given a brief introduction to the company and asked about my preferences for internship tasks. I chose to pursue a backend software engineering project and was given brief introductions to the team.

- Day 1!!! I arrived at the office to meet my boss, Mr. Len Chen, and he discussed with me expectations for the internship and a brief overview of what his team has developed.

- Today, I solved my issue with my .html files not found, and the reason was that I had created an additional directory for each of my .html pages to live in. I had copied what the tutorial had done, but I did not realize that adding another layer to the path would affect referencing my .html templates in the views.py file. Luckily, my search bar and page work! I watched two YouTube videos, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGtae4L5BbI&ab_channel=Codemy.com and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL5ZNCjXEbw&ab_channel=codepiep in order to create the page and the buttons.

### 11/1/23
- Did not come to the office today, had a test at NTU.

### 11/3/23
- Today, I am working on using Google Sheets as my database in Django. I have used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXDiqE4t0xA&ab_channel=TomDekan) and [website](https://www.photondesigner.com/articles/django-with-google-sheets-database?ref=yt-XXDiqE4t0xA-django-with-google-sheets-database) as references for source code. In my code, I have created a new file called ".env" and another new file called "services.py" that essentially acts as helpers for accessing Google Sheets and authenticating my queries. At the end of the day, I successfully connected Django wtih Google Sheets to query the network packet data!

### 11/10/13
- Back to the office after being sick with a cold or flu. I my goal today is to continue making the search bar and the website look better!
