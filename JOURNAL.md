# Journal Info
Hi! This is my journal which I plan to update whenever I work on projects or anything related to my internship. Each week, I come to the office Monday, Wednesday, and Friday before 8:30 AM and leave at 11:00 AM to attend my Chinese language classes at the National Taiwan University. The rest of my work is done remotely, and the in-person office days serve as a time when I can ask questions and continue doing work. While I am at the office, I also participate in the team check-in meetings at 10:30 AM.
